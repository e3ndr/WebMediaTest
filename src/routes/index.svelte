<h1>WebMediaTest</h1>
<p>
	Howdy, this website has sample media for testing the capabilities of lesser known/older browsers.
	<br />
	It's meant to be super compatible with most any device (hence the design, or lack thereof) and easy
	to use.
	<br />
	<br />
	This site also has Flash/FLV content for testing console browsers (like on the Wii or PSP).
	<br />
	<br />
	This site also has SSL set to optional, since modern certificates are not valid to older browsers.
	If you're still experiencing issues then you can try using
	<a href="http://insecure-wmt.e3ndr.xyz">http://insecure-wmt.e3ndr.xyz</a> instead, which has SSL forcefully
	set to OFF.
